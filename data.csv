Echidnas,"Echidnas are spiny anteaters belonging to the family Tachyglossidae, one of the four extant species of monotremes.  Monotremes are mammals that lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.  They are found in Australia and New Guinea.  There are four species of echidnas: the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), the long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus bruijnii), the Sir David Attenborough's long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus attenboroughi), and the eastern long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus bartoni).  Echidnas are characterized by their spiny bodies, long snouts, and powerful claws. They are insectivores, primarily feeding on ants and termites, which they locate using their electroreception abilities.  Their unique reproductive strategy involves laying a single leathery egg, which hatches after about 10 days.  The young then suckle milk from the mother's mammary glands, which lack nipples.  Echidnas are solitary animals and possess a low metabolic rate, allowing them to survive in various habitats.  Conservation efforts are underway for several echidna species, particularly the long-beaked echidnas, which are classified as vulnerable or endangered due to habitat loss and hunting.  Their evolutionary history traces back millions of years, making them fascinating examples of mammalian evolution and adaptation.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna;Various online sources on echidnas (accessed through general web search),wikipedia;search
