Python Programming Basics,"Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use.  Basic concepts include variables (used to store data), data types (like integers, strings, and booleans), operators (for performing operations), control flow (using `if`, `elif`, `else` statements and loops like `for` and `while`), and functions (to organize code into reusable blocks).  Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, while not strictly basic, are often introduced early and involve concepts like classes and objects.  Understanding these fundamentals allows you to write simple programs and build a foundation for more complex projects.",https://www.python.org/;https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/,wikipedia
Jupyter Notebook,"Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.  It's used extensively in data science, scientific computing, and education for its interactive capabilities and ease of sharing reproducible research.  Key features include support for multiple programming languages (like Python, R, Julia), rich media integration, and collaborative editing.",https://jupyter.org/,wikipedia
